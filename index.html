We spent 4 days in Vegas, 1 day in Kansas City, 3 days in Colorado. <br/>
Finished Resting in Kansas City before coming back home. <br/>
<h4> Fast paced Vegas for a Slow St. Louis Girl</h4>
<p>
Vegas is truly the  city that never sleeps. We left the hotel in the morning and came back exhausted at night. <br/>
We walked it seems like 100 miles sightseeing and enjoying different tourist things around the city. We took many different types of public transportation and had a blast!<br/>

            We enjoyed laying by the poolside, sightseeing, expericing new things, being CSI agents and overall just being able to spend time with one another.
